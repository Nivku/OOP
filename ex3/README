1.
Exceptions Package:
This package contains custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios.
IncorrectCommandException: Signals an error when an invalid argument value is encountered.
This exception is explicitly declared to ensure clarity in error handling.
IncorrectFormatException: This exception is raised when encountering
string that does not conform to the expected format or structure.
OutOfBoundsResException: Represents an error when an argument value falls outside the allowed range.
CharSetEmptyException: This exception is raised when attempting to run
the algorithm but the provided character set is empty.

Image Package:
Image: Represents an image object.
Utils: Contains various static functions and utilities for image manipulation.

ImageCharacterMatching Package:
CharConverter: Provides functions for converting characters to images and
representing brightness.
SubImageMatcher: Matches brightness levels to characters from a specified
character set. It relies on the Image class.

ASCII Art Package:
This package focuses on ASCII art generation algorithms.
AsciiOutputFactory: this is factory to create objects implements the interface
AsciiOutput, It incorporates a ConsoleAsciiOutput and HtmlAsciiOutput.
AsciiArtAlgorithm: Implements the main algorithm for ASCII art generation. It incorporates a SubImageMatcher
and an Image object.
KeyboardInput: Provided for user or test input handling.
Shell: Facilitates interaction with the user to adjust algorithm parameters and execute ASCII art generation.
It contains SubImageMatcher and depend Image, AsciiOutputFactory and KeyboardInput.

2.in SubImgCharMather -
    class TreeMap<Double, TreeSet<Integer>> charTreeSet - this data structures hold all the current
     chars as a set
    that suitable to its brightness as key, when we need specific brightness we can find in O(logn)
    the closest
    brightness to it from the possible brightness, the Tree set can give us the lowest value char
     with that
    brightness in O(1).
    TreeMap<Double, Integer> stretchedSet -this data structures hold all the current chars as a set
    that suitable to its brightness as key, when we need specific brightness we can find in
     O(logn) the closest
    brightness to it from the possible brightness
    Set<Integer> setToPrint - an Collection data structure that can be iterate and cannot hold double values,
    this structure used for get the String of the class.

3. we created 4 new Exception classes IncorrectFormatException, OutOfBoundsResException,
 IncorrectCommandException and CharSetEmptyException all inheritance from the class exception
  been a checked
 exception. all this exceptions has been throw in the current scope the error happened and been
  takin care of in
 the shell class in the run method.

4. we didnt change the API, we only override the method toString so when we needed to
print the current chars
that will be relevant foe the algorithm this method return a correct representation of them.
