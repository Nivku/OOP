1. We chose to delegate the responsibility of deleting bricks to the CollisionStrategy. every time there
   is a collision, onCollisionEnter of the Brick will call
   the onCollision of it strategy and the strategy will be removed.

   Disadvantages:
   1. The reason that the Strategy removes the brick, if there is DoubleBehaviorStrategy
   the method should call by Super to the other strategies which do the same things for the brick.

   Advantages:
   2. Every Strategy has the responsibility for its own brick, hence, remove the brick
   when there is a collision make it simple rule to keep.



2. because the Graphic display and the Numeric display are depends both on the number of "hearts" in the
game we decided to create class "LiveView" that includes display all the right objects
(hearts and numera) and manage
them by methods the remove and add the hearts.



3. Add Life:
   We created a class that implements the CollisionStrategy
   In the ReturnDisqualificationStrategy onCollision method that we override: if there
    is collision with Ball or Puck
   the method creates Heart that fall down from the center screen and the strategy
    removes the brick.

   Add Paddle:
   We created a class that implements the CollisionStrategy
   In the AddPaddleStrategy onCollision method that we override: if there is collision
    with Ball
   the method creates and remove the brick.
   also, we created a static boolean flag to check if there is only one SingletonPaddle
   during the game (it's not depends on specific instance) in addition, the singletonPaddle
   holds counter that every collision with ball or puck increments and after 4 collisions
   removes itself.


   special Camera:
   We created a class that implements the CollisionStrategy
   In the CameraCollisionStrategy onCollision method that we override: if there is
    collision with Ball or Puck
   the method checks if the camera is null and if so the method created game object of
   SpecialCamera which counts 4 times that the ball hit any object and then sets the
   camera to be null again.


   AddBalls:
   We created a class that implements the CollisionStrategy
   In the AddBallsStrategy onCollision method that we override: if there is collision with Ball
   the method creates new Puck ball at set the tag of it to puck to classify other
   Processes during the game.


4.DoubleBehavior implements CollisionStrategy, in its constructor this strategy
 randomly choose 2 or 3 behavior, were
first it choose between all possible strategies include itself and if the
 DoubleBehavior selected it will choose
3 behaviors, else choose 2. on collision this strategy will call all the
"onCollision" methods that it choose earlier.
